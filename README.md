# Block Blast Clone

A simple **Block Blast–style puzzle game** built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The goal is to place randomly generated block shapes onto a grid, clear full rows or columns, and score as many points as possible before no valid moves remain.

This project was built as a learning-focused clone, with an emphasis on:
- clean game state management
- canvas-based rendering
- intuitive drag-and-drop interactions
- modular, readable code structure

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – layout, responsiveness, minimal UI styling
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)** – game logic, rendering, state management
- **Canvas API** – grid and block rendering

No frameworks, no libraries — just fundamentals.
